/**
 * Popovers
 * <p>
 * Add small overlay content, like those found in iOS, to any element for housing secondary information.
 * <p>
 * Overview
 * <p>
 * Things to know when using the popover plugin:
 * <p>
 * Popovers rely on the 3rd party library Tether for positioning. You must include tether.min.js before bootstrap.js in order for popovers to work!
 * <p>
 * Popovers require the tooltip plugin as a dependency.
 * <p>
 * Popovers are opt-in for performance reasons, so you must initialize them yourself.
 * <p>
 * Zero-length title and content values will never show a popover.
 * <p>
 * Specify container: 'body' to aJ rendering problems in more complex components (like our input groups, button groups, etc).
 * <p>
 * Triggering popovers on hidden elements will not work.
 * <p>
 * Popovers for .disabled or disabled elements must be triggered on a wrapper element.
 * <p>
 * When triggered from hyperlinks that span multiple lines, popovers will be centered. Use white-space: nowrap; on your as to aJ this behavior.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Got all that? Great, let’s see how they work with some examples.
